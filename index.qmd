Welcome! My name is Josue (pronounced ho-sway). 

I’m a data scientist at McGraw Hill where I’m helping build personalized learning experiences at scale. Previously, I completed my PhD in Quantitative Psychology at UC Davis where I focused on developing Bayesian statistical models for social-behavior science.
