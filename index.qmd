Welcome! My name is Josue <small>([hear my name](https://www.howtopronounce.com/josue/705494))</small>. 

I’m a data scientist at McGraw Hill where I’m helping build personalized learning experiences at scale. Previously, I completed my PhD in Quantitative Psychology at UC Davis where I focused on developing Bayesian statistical methods for social-behavior science.
