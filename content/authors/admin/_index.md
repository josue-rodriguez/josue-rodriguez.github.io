Hi! My name is Josue. I'm a data scientist at McGraw Hill where I'm helping build personalized learning experiences at scale. Previously, I completed my PhD in Quantitative Psychology at UC Davis where I focused on developing Bayesian models for social-behavior science.

<!-- The things I like to do outside of work include playing and watching sports (mostly basketball and \[american\] football). I also spend time playing watching and playing chess. At home, I like to try cooking different types of food and experiment with different techniques. Generally, I like activities that allow me to learn new things and continually improve at them. -->
